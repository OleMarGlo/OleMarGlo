I’m a student at NTNU with intrests in Rust, Go, C/C++, Python, React/Next.js, and more. I love building modular, efficient, and scalable systems, whether it’s a simulation, API, or somethign i recently discoverd and want to explore.

I’m also passionate about hardware, API development, and system monitoring, and I enjoy exploring webdevelopment and creating CMS systems.
